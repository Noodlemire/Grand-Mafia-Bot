minArgs: Number
	- Specifies the minimum number of required parameters for a command.
	- If someone attempts to use the command with fewer than the required number of arguments, an error message will be provided.
	- The error message is auto-generated based on the name of the command typed, and the command's "param" field.

	- oname: Name of the Option. Must be lowercase alphanumeric, use - or _ in place of spaces, and 32 characters or less.
	- func: Additional functions for the SlashCommandBuilder, such as setDescription, setMinLength, setMaxValue, etc.
