Certain cards may interact with these may turn a dull totem into a hex totem (or a boon totem if someone wants to make them). Hex totems may not be changed into a different Hex totem, unless otherwise specified. A player with a hex totem who has their turn skipped may instead have their hex totem destroyed, making that totem unusable for the rest of the game. Additionally, players may choose to instead destroy a dull totem with a card that causes a playerâ€™s turn to be skipped, ending their turn.","id":29,"locked":false}
