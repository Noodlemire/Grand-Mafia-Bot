That number is how many cards can be drawn before the Exploding Kitten is drawn.\n- When the Exploding Kitten is drawn, the player who draws it immediately draws 6 cards.\n- Each time a player draws a card, they have a 20% chance of drawing a Defuse card, which is a wild <:wild:1106237191388143838> card. Players with a Defuse card will lose their Defuse card if they draw the Exploding Kitten, and place the Exploding Kitten back into the deck with a random timer from 5-30 again. They do not draw cards.\n- The Exploding Kitten is removed after someone draws cards due to the Exploding Kitten.","id":1724}
