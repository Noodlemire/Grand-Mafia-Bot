Instead, you must select a slot in your Spell Zone to put the card into, replacing and discarding any card already within that slot, if there is one.\n- Each turn, you may play a card from your Spell Zone instead of your hand, following standard color/number conditions. However, the chosen card will stay in your Spell Zone, instead of entering the Play Pile, allowing for re-use.\n- You cannot play the same card in the same Spell Zone slot more than once per turn.","id":374}
