And when it was solved, they came.\n- While in your ID zone, open a Gateway, building up **Chain Hunts** on every other player.\n- Every round, the **Chain Hunts** increase by 1.\n- When the **Chain Hunts** build up to 4, three chains grab every other player, inflicting 1 **Gloom** for every Chain on top of them.\n- A player may skip their turn and draw a <:red:1106234051129507932> card to pull a chain out, removing 1 stack of **Gloom**. **THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO REMOVE IT, BESIDES THE ðŸ†” BEING REMOVED.**\n- Alternatively, a player may skip their next 3 turns to solve the Lament Configuration, gaining 3 <:partisan:1107460550268559380> points and drawing 2 <:partisan:1107460550268559380> cards. This ends the **Chain Hunts,** resetting the timer, and also removes all Chains from every player.\n- Also, when the **Chain Hunts** are active, all players who have less cards then the one with this ðŸ†” get a chain every round, and anyone who plays a negative effect on the one with this ðŸ†” gets a chain.\n- Also, the one with this ðŸ†” may skip their turn to place a chain on any player of their choosing.","id":240}
