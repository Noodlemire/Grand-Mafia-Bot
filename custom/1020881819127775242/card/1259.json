(This does not trigger effects which harm you for giving other players cards or forcing other players to draw (ie: Veteran). This effect does not skip anyone's turn.)\n- When a player has four-of-a-kind (four of the same numbered cards), they must say \"Spoon\" in chat. All players must also type \"Spoon\". The last player to type \"Spoon\" draws 3 and the Spoon Repairman is removed. You can't delete this message or alter it, it must remain \"Spoon\" to be valid.\n- If players type \"Spoon\" before they have four-of-a-kind, they draw 3 and the Spoon Repairman is removed.\n- If multiple players did not type \"Spoon\" in response to another player saying it and all players have had their turn, then all Spoon-less players draw 3 and the Spoon Repairman is removed.","id":1259}
