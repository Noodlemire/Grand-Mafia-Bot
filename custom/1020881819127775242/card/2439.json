That person gets to randomly distribute as many cards as they bid. Any losers also gain **Card Shards** equal to 1.5 times the amount they bid, rounded down.\n - If you do not bid, you are exempt from the potluck. However, if you have no more than 3 cards, you can still draw cards from the potluck.","id":2439}
