Rather than applying their effects immediately, attacked players are first warned of an incoming attack, giving them time to block using a Defense card if they own one.\n\nAttacking cards have special behavior when Fused. Unless stated otherwise, both attacks will actually combine into one, rather than both effects simply happening simultaneously. This means that while they are more powerful and more capable of killing a player, they are also typically weaker against defense cards.\n\nAttacking cards typically are limited by Range, an additional factor that determines who they can be used on, based on the public Player List.\n\nFor example: Say the player list is:\n1. Bob\n2. Alice\n3. Jane\n4. Jerry\n5. Rick\n6. Mandy\n7. Alfred\n\nMandy, with an attack with 2 range, can target Jerry, Rick, Alfred, or Bob. But Bob, with a card with 1 range, can only target Alice or Alfred.","id":0}
