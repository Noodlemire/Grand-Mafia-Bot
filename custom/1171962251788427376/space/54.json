If the total is 12, you will find the object.\n- Finding a property or space allows you to replace any tile with that property or space once leaving. Finding a set allows you to replace all of  the properties of a set with the set you found once leaving. Owned Properties cannot be replaced, and if replacing a set only a portion of the properties are owned, the ones replaced no longer need to be owned to own the set. Finding a chest card or a chance card will have it apply as soon as you leave.\n- You may choose whether or not you want to stay in The Realm of Forgotten Things after finding an object. If you do not find an object, it is impossible to leave.\n- Once you have spent 5 rounds in The Realm, you die, and all of your properties are reset."}],"meta":{},"desc":"Post 55","id":54,"locked":false}
