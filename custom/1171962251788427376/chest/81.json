You move to the position of the player to the right of you on the board (or below you in this format), that player moves to the position of the next player on the board, and so on. If a player has modifiers to their dice, they take effect, altering the position they land on.\n* If this card and Counterclockwise somehow trigger at the same time, everyone gets crushed by the pressure, loses half their money, and mortgages half their properties. No one moves and the next turn begins immediately.","id":81,"locked":false}
