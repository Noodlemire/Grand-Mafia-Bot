The host reveals who won, and the winner steals 50$ from the loser.\n\nThe first time you defeat each player in battle, gain \"[username]'s Gym Leader Badge\" and add it to this individual instance of this card. Once you have 8 gym badges, you gain 500$ and this card is consumed.\n- If there are less than 9 players in-game, you instead only need to acquire every other players' badge to receive the 500$.\n- If this card is traded, it retains its existing badges.\n- If you're on a tile with another player you already have the gym badge of, challenging them is optional.","id":64,"locked":false}
