However, you must pay the Rent to the Bank when you Drive By or Stop In - and nothing can prevent you from paying.\n- War: Once per turn, select a Property that someone else chose to buy, and enter a Closed Auction (or join it if there was already going to be one). If you win, your money goes to your opponent in this Auction (or is split between them if there are multiple).\n- Famine: Each turn, every player (including yourself) loses $100.\n- Pestilence: Each turn, the player who started with the most money becomes unable to collect Rent for the rest of that turn (anybody who would pay Rent to them will pay it to the Bank instead).
