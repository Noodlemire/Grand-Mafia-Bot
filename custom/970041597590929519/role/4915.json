They get dealt a Powerful attack and you gain a Faith point.\n- Seems like no one would ever accept, right? But here's the catch. At the end of the game, if it ends in a Hallow victory, you can choose **one** non-Hallow member to revive and win with you.\n- For every 2 Faith points you accumulate, the Saint gains a Saint point. You didn't think it would be easy, did you?"}],"meta":{},"desc":"Post 2483\n*Originally a member of the Partisans, the Heretic was persuaded when he met the Saint face to face. \"The sun will take it's time\", he said. \"The Paragon will bring us **retribution**.\"*","id":4915,"locked":false}
