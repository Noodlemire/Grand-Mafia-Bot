They will be planted within a spot of your choice in the cube. They will be notified of this, but won't know where they are in the cube. Every day/night, along with their ability, they must choose a directionâ€”up, down, left, right, forwards or backwards. Their ability will be redirected to a different sector in respects to their current position and the direction they chose. If the ability were to escape the cube, it would affect everyone not currently in Caino's dimension. If the direction chosen leads to an empty square, the target is essentially roleblocked.\n- Caino is also forced inside the cube, in a sector which he himself may choose on Day 1.\n- You may post pictures of grapes in <#970059745807437876>.
