Instead, you have a **Damage Zone**. Each time you're attacked at night, depending on the attack tier, you'll take an amount of damage. Basic and below will deal 1 damage, Powerful will deal 2 damage, Unstoppable will deal 3 damage and Overkill+ *and* lynching will deal 4 damage. Once you've taken 8 damage, you will die. For technical purposes, this isn't an attribute, just an explanation.\n- You're immune to any negative effects that occur alongside attacks, such as an attack which would roleblock and attack or Firefly (319)'s attack.\n- You cannot publicly claim as your role, as that would take away from the pleas- I mean, take away from the point. Publicly claiming or implying your role deals 2 Overkill attacks immediately. Once you've taken at least 5 damage, this attribute no longer applies.\n- This role cannot spawn unless 3+ killing roles are in the game. Factions with factional kills count as one role for this requirement.\n- You may multitask."},{"name":"Goal:","value":"Take 5+ damage without dying, then survive until the end of the game."}],"meta":{},"desc":"Post 2431\n*It's not sexual, I swear.*","id":4948,"locked":false}
