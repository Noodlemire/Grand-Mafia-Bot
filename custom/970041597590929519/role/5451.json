Attempted visitors get the message \"You tried to visit your target, but they were kidnapped!\"\n- Kidnapped players cannot act. This goes through roleblock and control immunity.\n- You may speak to your Kidnapped target at night.\n - You are considered a \"jailor-type\" role, for roles who interact with them (such as serial killers who kill the jailor if not executed).\n- Other Vampires may visit the Kidnapped target.\n- Once per game you may Kidnap a Vampire. They can still perform their night action, but others may not visit them."},{"name":"Goal:","value":"Make man pay for their crimes against the natural order."}],"meta":{},"desc":"Post 5260\n*\"We are bound by blood.
