The gun in your hands fills you with a sort of adrenaline. It's hard to explain, but sooner or later you might go insane with this power held in your hands.*\n\nAbilities\n- You may shoot a player, dealing them a Basic attack. (3 uses)\n- Alternatively, you may go **Berserk**. Shooting a random player for every bullet you currently have, and losing every bullet.\n\nAttributes\n- You take one night to reload all of your bullets.\n- Once you've reloaded, a 2 Night Timer begins.\n- If you do not shoot a player by the night the timer reaches 0, you will automatically go **Berserk**.\n- Killing a Town member causes you to go **Berserk** the next night.\n- You do not die of guilt.","id":5596,"locked":false}
