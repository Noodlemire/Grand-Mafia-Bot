This is because they're dead and when you die your role gets revealed because that's how the game works.\n- After split players die, they may not act at night, because they're dead and, once again, that's how the game works. If they have abilities they can normally use when dead, well, they can cope, because you killed their soul so hard they can't anymore.\n- You may target yourself.
