This is announced at the start of the game or when it triggers.\n- There is a tree between each player's house. When players die, their house becomes another tree.\n- Players can only move through an amount of trees equal to half the number of players there were at the beginning of the game (not counting you) rounded up minus one. This doesn't apply to Astral abilities or indirect effects. This means they can target anyone as long as everyone's alive, but as players die and get replaced with trees, they lose access to further away players.\n- Players can use abilities on trees as long as they can move there. Trees have no defense, and are removed if they would die."},{"name":"Attributes (cont.):","value":"- At the end of the game, you become a player again so that your goal can be evaluated.\n- You may reroll this for free."},{"name":"Goal:","value":"Have there be at least X more trees than there were to start with, where X is the number of players there were at the beginning of the game minus 5."}],"meta":{},"desc":"Post 3215\n*Yes, it's literally just a forest*","id":2612,"locked":false}
