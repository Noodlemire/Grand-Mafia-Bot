If you have a negative attack value, nothing happens. If you have no attacking abilities, you gain a one-use kill.\n - You cannot be voted out of the game.\n - Other players, instead of their night action, can attempt to steal the Key. One random player will succeed at this.\n - After losing the Key, you will commit suicide in 3 phases (so if you lose it N1, you die D3).
