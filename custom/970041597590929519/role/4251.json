You have infinite rerolls on this until you confirm it so you can choose a role that actually makes sense.\n- If someone refers to the role you have by anything except its name (misspellings, acronyms, its role number, pronouns, or anything else), they become marked. You cannot mark yourself.\n- Once all living players that would oppose you are marked, immediately deal an Overkill attack to all marked players, including ones that don't oppose you if they're marked.\n- Players can only become marked from day chats, private channels, whispers, factional chats, other private chats (including anonymous ones), and any other channel that exists in the current game. Channels outside of the game will not mark players."},{"name":"Attributes (cont.):","value":"- If you die, don't. Instead, select 1/3rd of all letters in your fake role's original name.
