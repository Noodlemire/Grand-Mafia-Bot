They will not have the dead role or be in the dead chat, but cannot talk, vote, or use any abilities (unless they could normally while dead). They still count towards majority, abilities and votes will work on them as normal, and frozen players count as alive to every faction's win condition, except Coven. (yes, Town will have to kill a frozen Serial Killer, even if they can't do anything)\n- With the Necronomicon, anyone who visits a frozen player is roleblocked. Anyone who visits a frozen player twice in a row will automatically be frozen and you'll be notified of this. Furthermore, your attack power is increased to Unstoppable.\n- With the Necronomicon, all frozen players receive Basic defense, if they did not already have defense."}],"meta":{},"desc":"Post 2219","id":5111,"locked":false}
