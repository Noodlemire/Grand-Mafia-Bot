They will NOT be able to use abilities OR talk within the day chat until one day has passed. However, one of the players within the game (At random) HAS A GUN and if you knock this specific player out you will obtain the gun. Additionally if they die THE GUN IS YOURS\n- Once you have obtained the gun you can finally use this ability. You will ATTACK SOMEONE WITH THE GUN BY THROWING IT AT THEM and deal a powerful attack to them.\n- Additionally roles that have guns according to flavor (Like Sniper Post 341) will count as a person that has a gun according to your ability actually.\n- Do not worry though because you can continue to use your foldable chair EVEN AFTER having found your gun, and in fact you are quite good at dual-wielding so you can actually use them both simultaneously."},{"name":"Goal:","value":"Complete the neutral killing."}],"meta":{},"desc":"Post 868","id":3964,"locked":false}
