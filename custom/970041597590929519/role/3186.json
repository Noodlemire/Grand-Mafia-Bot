Their actions become Astral and Rampaging, go through immunities, are immune to sabotage (including priority changes, ability blockers, etc), and deal Overkill attacks if they can kill. Protective roles simply block attacks instead of giving defense, etc. etc. They gain all immunities, and cannot have them ignored. Whatever else needs to happen to upgrade their role in any way will happen.\n- Redlined players will die the night after they are inflicted with the status, and then cannot be resurrected or have their corpse manipulated. This is not in any way, shape or form preventable or reversible.\n- You may only target each player once.\n- If your target received more than one means of protection on the night that you targeted them, including you, then Redlining them will not kill them, but will wear off the next night."}],"meta":{},"desc":"Post 2691\n*Let's have no regrets.
