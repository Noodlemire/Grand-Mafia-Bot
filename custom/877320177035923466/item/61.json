Guess that works?*\n\nWhen used as a shield, this door will make you practically invincible to direct attacks, and it will allow you to freely open doors without using Keys. However, each hit you take will take a Key away from you, and if you have none to lose when you get hit, you'll instead die instantly.\n\nIt also won't protect against damage from status effects, so you should always keep at least a couple healing items at the ready.\n","id":61}
