Such grace! ...Is that blood?*\n\nWhile these only provide you with 6 defense, you will be greatly attuned to the ebb and flow of combat. You will always be able to predict the result of your next damage roll (modifiers factored in), and can thus plan your next move accordingly.\n\nYou won't see the prediction outside of battle, only within it. If you've used other commands since your last `!e door` or `!e attack`, your `!e stats` page will also list it in parenthesis next to your Attack stat.\n\nIf your enemy is under the Smokescreen effect, you won't know if your attack will hit or not, only the damage it would deal if you don't miss.","id":93}
