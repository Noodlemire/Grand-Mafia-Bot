But, each time an enemy tries to hit you but fails (due to being dodged or stunned), you will also gain Absorption 5.\n\nThis acts as a stackable 5 HP's worth of shielding, but only for the remainder of the current battle. Leftover Absorption will be wasted, but that just means you probably didn't lose HP instead.\n\nTry to keep a stock of stunning items handy. Dodging with Wings can work, but you'll be taking lots of extra damage due to the low defense of both items, unless you can build up a reliable Absorpion stock first.\n","id":94}
