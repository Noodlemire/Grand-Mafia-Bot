Stacks additively. (x2, then x3, then x4, etc.)\n\nThis item will not multiply items that earn you bonus points (but will multiply their gold), and it won't work at all against rare monsters. It won't affect bonus items provided by your own equipment. Trying to reroll multiplied loot of any kind will un-multiply the result.\n","id":98}
