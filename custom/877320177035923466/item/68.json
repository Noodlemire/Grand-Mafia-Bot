If the enemy is already Poisoned, attacking it again will increase its Poison level, making each attack more deadly than the last.\n\nAgainst frail enemies, regular weapons with higher base damage will always beat out Poison, especially because the enemy will always get its turn before Poison damage is applied. However, enemies that normally take a while to kill get easily overwhelmed by the repeated stacking of this effect.\n","id":68}
