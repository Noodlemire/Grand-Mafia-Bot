As long as you do, you will also start the battle with 💛 Absorption 10, acting as a 10 HP shield against damage.\n\nExcess Absorption vanishes at the end of the battle, so consider carefully if you really want to use this shield or not. It has no downside in longer battles, but 1-turn or low-damage fights become much more draining than normal.","id":69}
