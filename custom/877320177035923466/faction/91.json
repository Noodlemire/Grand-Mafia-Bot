That player is a townie, and must keep them alive until the end of the game.\nBecause of this, animatronics cannot whisper.\nIf the target dies through any means, all animatronics will learn the role of their attacker, and their goal will be changed to eliminate them.\nIf they are converted to another faction, they will not be informed.\nIf they are killed by a town player, the townie that killed them is immediately stripped of their attack, and can only hide twice per game at night, which temporarily grants them overprotective defense. This does not happen if the target was converted to an REF. Instead, they become the new target.\nAt night, there is a factional overwatch that any animatronic can perform, which purges the target. Each animatronic can only purge twice."},{"name":"Goal:","value":"Ensure the safety and security of INSERT_CHILD_NAME_HERE."}],"meta":{"inherit_fields":"Goal:Ensure the safety and security of INSERT_CHILD_NAME_HERE."},"id":91}
