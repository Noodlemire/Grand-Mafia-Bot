For example, you can use 1 ability on night 1, or 4 on night 4.\n- You must use each ability once before you can use them another time. This carries over between nights. (If you've used 3/4 of your abilities before Night 3 for example, on Night 3, you must use your fourth ability. Then you can choose any 2 distinct abilities of the 4 to use at the same time. Like a deck of four cards that gets reshuffled whenever it gets emptied.)\n- You have Vulnerable Defense if only 1 or fewer Striked players are alive. Otherwise, you have None Defense."}],"meta":{},"desc":"Post 1728","id":215}
