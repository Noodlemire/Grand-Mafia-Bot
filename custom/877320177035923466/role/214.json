They can only choose the order, or allow RNG to decide for them.\n- Dancing will bypass other rules about what an ability is allowed to target. I.E. if an ability normally can't self-target, and/or requires a specific number of players, it'll be able to self-target anyways.\n- Self-targeting as a result of Dancing is considered to be a visit, meaning players will attack themselves if they use abilities that would normally target their own visitors.\n- During the PMCS, you will deal an Unstoppable Attack to your target at the end of the night."}],"meta":{},"desc":"Post 1259\n*Likes: Puppets, Dancing.
