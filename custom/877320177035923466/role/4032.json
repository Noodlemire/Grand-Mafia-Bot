Protections that heal (like Doctor) will not protect against your attack, but any protections that retaliate (like Bodyguard) will. Your target will not appear to die until either their soul disintegrates or you replace their soul, but they will have all other attributes of being dead, except the dead chat. You may have one soul at a time, and a soul lasts for two nights after obtaining it until it disintegrates. You may whisper as a person whose soul you have, and anyone who tries to whisper a player who had their soul stolen will have it sent to you, but the Town will not know this."},{"name":"Goal:","value":"NK Goal"}],"meta":{},"desc":"Post 851","id":4032,"locked":false}
