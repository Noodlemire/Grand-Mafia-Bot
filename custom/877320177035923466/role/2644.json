Roleblocking, being jailed, controls, redirects, even anything that would bypass immunity does not apply.** Even if you moved normally, you can still move out of check. Even if you moved then attacked, this attribute still applies."},{"name":"Goal:","value":"Protect the King from checkmate and deliver mate to the enemy."}],"meta":{},"desc":"Post 3194","id":2644,"locked":false}
