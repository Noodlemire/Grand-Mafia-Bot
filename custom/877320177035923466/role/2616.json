The Good faction is Green, REFs and NKs are Red, and other Neutrals are White. When you scout someone, you learn how many connecting people/chips have the same color, including the target. (e.g. if you scout a Townie with one Town neighbor and the other surrounding players are Evil, you get a result of 2.)\n- Whenever someone is part of a line of four of the same color, they die. All chips that were part of this sequence are removed from play.\n- Wild chips can count for any color. You may only place 2 Wild chips throughout the game.\n- Once only yourself and four other people are alive, you may place two chips each night.\n- At the start of the game, no one can be part of a sequence of 4."},{"name":"Goal:","value":"Kill all who would oppose you."}],"meta":{},"desc":"Post 3211\n*It's much less fun making these Town roles.*","id":2616,"locked":false}
