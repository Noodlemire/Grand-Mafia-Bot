Better performances earn better stats, while poor storytelling leaves you vulnerable.\n- The host must be an honest judge of your performance; a host cannot give you poor stats for a good performance, nor reward mediocracy.  However, the host is allowed to judge based upon their personal preferences for storytelling (genre, grammatical strictness, etc.).  You may ask the host their preferences and they must tell you; the host may not change their preferences during the game."},{"name":"Goal:","value":"Town goal."}],"meta":{},"desc":"Post 3525\n*Roleplaying is the highest form of storytelling, you just don't understand me, mom!*","id":2387,"locked":false}
