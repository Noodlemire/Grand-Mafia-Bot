The percent chance of this happening is equal to the night number times 7 (e.g. on Night 3, you have a 21% chance of slipping on a banana peel). It is specifically 7 because 7 is a funny number.\n- If you successfully attack your target, you will tell your target a hilarious joke as you're murdering them. This has a 50% chance of causing them to suffer from a laughing fit as you murder them which upgrades your attack to Powerful.\n- If you are roleblocked, you will attack the roleblocker in addition to your target.  You may still slip on a banana peel while attacking your roleblocker.\n- When you automatically attack a roleblocker, the roleblocker will have a 100% chance of suffering from a laughing fit, and their roleblock will fail. Their will will be dissolved in water from a squirting flower that you comedically sprayed on their will."},{"name":"Attributes (cont.):","value":"- At night, you may choose to clown around at your house.
