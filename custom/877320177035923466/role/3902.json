For example, a Magical Blast with 1 charge aimed at Player #10 will also attack Player #9 and Player #11.\n- If a player is missing from Magical Blast's attack range, that just means your attack has hit one less player. For example, a Magical Blast with 1 charge aimed at Player #10 will not compensate for a missing #9 or #11 by hitting #8 or #12.
