You will twist the mind of the first, controlling them into the second target tomorrow night. You learn all feedback. If the twisted-mind target has multiple targets themselves, you will only alter their first. The first time you use this ability, it will fail.\n- Swap roles with a player at night, with the exception of faction and goal staying the same. This happens after all other actions resolve that night. You cannot use this on the same night as another ability."},{"name":"Attributes:","value":"- If you are alive and Metamorph-aligned in a Metamorph victory, that victory is nullified and the Good faction wins instead."}],"meta":{},"desc":"Post 2977\n*Your mind can become a weaponâ€”one you may wield, or one you may suffer by.*","id":4643,"locked":false}
