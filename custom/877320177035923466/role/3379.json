They will be given a list of five possible roles they could have turned into that are within their alignment/subalignment with one of these roles being the actual role they were turned into.\n- After two full day and night phases, a player whose mind has been erased must decide what role they have been turned into. They will have until the end of the day to decide on one role that they have been turned into at which point the host will determine if they have correctly figured out their role. If they have not correctly determined their role by the end of the day, they will die of an aneurysm dealing an Astral Unstoppable attack to them.\n- Your ability fails on any roles in a Power-type subalignment. It will also fail on any role with less than ten roles in the same alignment/subalignment."},{"name":"Goal:","value":"See the good faction lose the game."}],"meta":{},"desc":"Post 2515\n*Doctor, I can't tell if I'm not me!*","id":3379,"locked":false}
