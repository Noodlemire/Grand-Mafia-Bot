Meaning, you will lose access to the private channel you were previously occupying upon using your ability. This also means you'll lose access to your own private channel the first time you use this ability.\n- You cannot select the same person twice until you've invaded everyone's personal space at least once. You also can't self-target at all.\n- While invading another player's personal space, you will be targeted by everything that targets them, as if you were in their home. However, anything targeting *you* will fail, and those targeting you will just receive \"*No one's home.*\" as feedback.\n- You'll have access to the day chat, but won't be able to talk there. You can still talk in your target's private channel, though, if you want to.\n- You __must__ use your ability every night."},{"name":"Goal:","value":"Survive until the end of the game."}],"meta":{},"desc":"Post 743","id":2912,"locked":false}
