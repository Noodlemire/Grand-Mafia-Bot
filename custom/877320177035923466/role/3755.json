In its heyday, during the late 1800's and very early 1900's, under the rule of Queen Victoria the British Empire controlled one-quarter of the world's population and a quarter of the Earth's total land area.*\n*Additionally, the 1800's provided the inventions and improvements in Farm Machinery to change farming from an extremely labor intensive industry to technology driven. The creation of Combine Harvesters which took three separate operations (reaping, binding, and threshing) and combined them into one, traction engines/tractors, and vastly improved plowing and planting machines led to increased automation. Increased automation allowed for cultivation on an ever greater scale. These improvements also led to decades of extensive farming without crop rotation, fallow fields, cover crops or other techniques to prevent erosion and were one of the contributing factors to the Dust Bowl years of the 1930's (Combined with severe drought).*","id":3755,"locked":false}
