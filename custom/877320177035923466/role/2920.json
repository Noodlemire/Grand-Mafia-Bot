They'll spend the entire night reviewing their notes, and are thus roleblocked.\n- Prepare a pop quiz during the day. At night, everyone who you've taught in the past is gathered in a night channel. The host will post three multiple choice questions about rocks for the students to answer in their private channel. This ability can only be used once, because you only have so much paper."},{"name":"Attributes:","value":"- The questions should have 3 choices each.\n- The actual answers don't matter, because you can't be bothered marking, but if any students share at least two answers with any others, you'll accuse them of cheating and assault them powerfully.\n- Everyone involved is also roleblocked, because doing night actions while you're taking a pop quiz is harder than you'd think.\n- If anyone points out the irony of a rock teaching geology, they're dealt a Basic attack 863 times."}],"meta":{},"desc":"Post 1227","id":2920,"locked":false}
