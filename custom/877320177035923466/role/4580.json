All players you invited are roleblocked that night.\n- Destroying a player's house forces them to select another player. That player may choose to accept or decline their request. If they decline, the first player must choose a different player, but if they accept, the first player moves into the second player's house. The first player is no longer a valid target to visit (but they can still be voted, and this is public), and all visits to the second player also apply to the first player.
