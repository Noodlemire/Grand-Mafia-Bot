Hanging a target will only satisfy the win condition if the player voted the target (or voted guilty). If someone's target dies to someone that isn't themselves, their target's target is now their target. Your attack level is always one level higher than your target's defense level.\n- If your target changes roles, you are notified. Your target will remain the same, and you'll learn the new role.\n- Players must complete their original goal AND kill their target to win.\n- Evil faction members cannot have someone who is on their team as their target. This is removed if this would cause it to be physically impossible for some players to have a target."},{"name":"Goal:","value":"Eliminate your target."}],"meta":{},"desc":"Post 819","id":4017,"locked":false}
