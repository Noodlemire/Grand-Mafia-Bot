No abilities that interact with you will affect you in any way whatsoever. You are absolutely immune to everything in the game possible that can happen to any player whatsoever, except for being lynched normally during the day, at a grade even higher than the Commuter. You do not count towards the majority. Your vote does nothing (it will appear to). You cannot hear whispers. If you are the last Discordian alive, the Discordians will lose."}],"meta":{},"desc":"Post 1653\nAstral Visitor","id":3192,"locked":false}
