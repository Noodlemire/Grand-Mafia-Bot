You gain Basic defense, and the ability to self-target. Your abilities are also no longer restricted to just Rocks, so you'll be able to use them on any player in the game. Finally, you'll be able to use your abilities in addition to the factional Rock kill, and are able to use multiple abilities each night. Your alignment is also changed to Rock Head, which doesn't change anything gameplay wise, but is very cool."}],"meta":{},"desc":"Post 1352","id":2923,"locked":false}
