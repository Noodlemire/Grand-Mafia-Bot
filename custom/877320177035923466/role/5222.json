A Vigilante shooting it will commit suicide out of guilt, but the Ringmaster can sacrifice it as if it were a member of the Pale Moon. It can't exist with Unique roles, because it is those roles. A Caporegime can copy its abilities, because it's a Mafia role (except like actually only the third one because rule). Wow, Rasen is actually explaining in-depth how one of their fucked up mechanics work for once. Isn't that nice."},{"name":"Abilities:","value":"- Copy an ability of any Unique role each night.\n- Gain an attribute of any Unique role each night.\n- Become another player at night.
