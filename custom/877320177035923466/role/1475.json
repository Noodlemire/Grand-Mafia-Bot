This includes death. Unfortunately you only have 3 bottles of ink so you can only do this 3x.\n- **Ink Throw**: You throw an empty bottle of Ink at someone, knocking them out instantly somehow. They cannot do anything tonight. Now here's the thing, you may only use this if you have an empty bottle of ink (you gain one if you use Ink Blotting).  If you try to use this while you have no empty bottles, but you have a full bottle of ink then you throw a full bottle of ink, removing a use of Ink Blotting and causing your throw to have more weight, killing the target and spilling Ink all over their role, obscuring it. It's up to the host to decide whether everyone can tell that Ink got all over the victim or not. This ability is too long."},{"name":"Abilities (cont.):","value":"Goal: There is a 50% chance you will spawn in as in place of any town slot (you can't see mafia chat) because you didn't get the memo, host may decide this or leave it up to rng.
