Instead, you just make them die. No matter what. Nothing can save them, no defense can save them.\n- Except for very specific protective roles like Paramedic that don't really give defense. Or death immunity. That will save your victim. If your victim survives for any reason, the effect will be delayed by one day/night instead."}],"meta":{},"desc":"Post 2247","id":5095,"locked":false}
