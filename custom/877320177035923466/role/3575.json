Everyone will perform their abilities on the player that ends up at the spot they chose after your shift takes affect.\n- With the Necronomicon, the player at slot #1 after your shift will be dealt a Powerful Attack. Choosing to do a faux shift will not offset anyone's targets, but it will offset the player list at the end of the night changing who ends up at slot #1. The Town will not be notified when you choose to do a faux shift.\n- Other members of the Coven are immune to shifts."},{"name":"Attributes (cont.):","value":"- Your night ability cannot be stopped for any reason."},{"name":"Goal:","value":"Kill all who will not submit to the Coven."}],"meta":{},"desc":"Post 331\n*Goddamn sticky keys...*","id":3575,"locked":false}
