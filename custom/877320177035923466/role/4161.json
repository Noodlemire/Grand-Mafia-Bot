Conversion roles will convert people to their *new* faction. Furthermore, anything that is designed around a role being in a specific faction (like Ace and Hex Master) will automatically have its wording changed. People can keep their original faction, but only if the randomizer says they do. They don't choose to keep it.\nIf Town becomes Neutral, their goal is to survive. If a non-killing REF role becomes Neutral, their goal is to see the Town lose. If a killing REF role becomes Neutral, their goal is to kill everyone else.\nThe end outcome will always ensure there is the same number of people per faction as there was in the start.
