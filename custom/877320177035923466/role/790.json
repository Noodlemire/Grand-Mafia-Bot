While everyone can see this channel, there are only four anonymous participants at random, one of which is you. Each player will take turns selecting 1-3 words from this pool to add to a new role card. The words can be placed anywhere in the card. A player may opt to finalize their custom role card, and their original role card will be replaced with that. They will be removed from the turn queue.\n- The other three players may not tamper with their role name, alignment, subalignment or win condition. However, you must craft a role name and win condition yourself. An alignment and subalignment will be added for you at the host's discretion after your card is complete.\n- All role cards must be crafted by Day 3, otherwise the contestants' role cards are replaced with whatever they have."},{"name":"Goal:","value":"Create a new card, make the host cope, and win."}],"meta":{},"desc":"Post 2888\n*hehehehehehe  *bites fingers with the hippos *hehehehehehe*","id":790}
