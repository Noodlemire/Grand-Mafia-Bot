You steal a random role's abilities and attributes from the slot you rolled from, and it can be any faction, as long as there are not multiple Ancient Gods in an informes faction. In an informed faction, you will be seen as your stolen role; only in death and investigations will you be seen as an Ancient God. You may perform your individual kill and stolen ability in the same night. Your individual attack value is the value of your stolen role, but one tier higher. If you exist, the Town will know this on day one, and informed faction members can use all abilities on each other. Under no circumstance can your individual attack kill another Ancient God - but your stolen attack can. On death, your real and disguised role are both revealed.
