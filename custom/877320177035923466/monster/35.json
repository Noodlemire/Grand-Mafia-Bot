But defeat it, and you will be awarded one of five useful equipment pieces which can't be obtained elsewhere.\n\nHigh damage will matter more to this fight than defense. Whenever the Silly Toy Soldier deals 4 or less damage, it will gain Tough 3, Lucky 1, and increase its Max Attack by 3. This ensures it will quickly reboumd from any attempt to reduce its damage, and prolong the fight for that matter.\n\nThis enemy has an unusually small range of depths which it can spawn in.\n","id":35}
