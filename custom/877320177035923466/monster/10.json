However, because it stuns you, your other status effects will deplete more rapidly.\n\nIt always drops armor that provides stun immunity, which will make future Speedrunner encounters much less damaging. However, only a small handful of other monsters are capable of stunning you.\n\nNaturally, it's wearing its own equipment, so you can't stun it either.\n","id":10}
