If you're 110 floors deep, you should really consider using either the Speedrunner's equipment, or the Safety Vest, to reduce or negate the impact of this surprise. If you have the materials, it's also very useful to keep Nazars around at this point, so you can use exclusively high-tier armor that doesn't provide any stun resistance by itself.\n\nOn top of that, this monster is simply strong in general, and it only gets worse from here. You may be able to keep up with its stat scaling, but it and the other end-game monsters will eventually overwhelm you, one way or another.\n","id":33}
