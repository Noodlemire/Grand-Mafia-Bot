The exact monster will depend on the amount of HP that the Demon has left. The weaker the Demon is, the weaker the Shadow it summons.\n\nThis summoning is triggered whether you use a regular attack, or an item-based attack. Uniquely, using direct-damage items against the Demon will let it take its turn, and allow status effects to process.\n\nShadows have their stats scaled to what they would be if they spawned on Depth 100, even if it's a monster not normally capable of appearing this deep into the Dungeon. In addition, Shadows never drop loot, and they do not offer you any chance to use Preparation items before the Demon returns to let you attack once again.\n\nThis is a battle of endurance, above all else. Plan and prepare accordingly.\n\nThis monster is immune to Scrolls, Fine Wine, and the Stun effect.\n","id":31}
