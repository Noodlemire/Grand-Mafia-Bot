If your weapon rolls its highest possible damage for any reason, this monster will immediately gain +5 Strength and +5 Tough, and cause you to Bleed, all for 3 turns. This means it deals more damage and takes a lot less damage, and you won't be able to heal at all during this period.\n\nWhatever you do, don't bring the Lucky effect into this fight, if you can avoid it. Having Bleeding stacked on your for an extended period of time can almost certainly spell your doom. Alternatively, it can't counter your max rolls if it simply dies first.","id":30}
