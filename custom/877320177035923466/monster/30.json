If your weapon rolls its highest possible damage for any reason, this monster will immediately gain +5 Strength for 3 turns, and cause you to Bleed for 3 turns, which prevents you from healing.\n\nWhatever you do, don't bring the Lucky effect into this fight, if you can avoid it. Having Bleeding stacked on your for an extended period of time can almost certainly spell your doom. Alternatively, it can't counter your max rolls if it simply dies first.\n","id":30}
