Use a gun. If that doesn't work? Use more gun.*\n\nThis monster will increase its own damage output permanenty, based on the damage of its previous attack. In other words, its attack stat will grow exponentially over the course of the battle.\n\nDon't let it get to that point! Stunning it, or dodging its attacks early on, will buy you a lot of time to kill it before its damage grows out of control. Alternatively, because its initial damage is so low, it's possible to reduce its damage output to 0, in which case it can't do anything to you.\n","id":19}
