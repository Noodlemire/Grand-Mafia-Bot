The prediction can be presented casually for the sake of subtlety. (“inb4 \\_ dies” would be valid.) The host should not accept a prediction so vague it would be trivial to fulfill (“someone will die”), or crafted to be easy to fulfill (“I will visit \\_”). This can be reattempted if deemed invalid. If the prediction is fulfilled at any point (by chance or your own doing), you gain 1 ammo for a night ability of your choice, and permanently increase your attack power by 0.1x."},{"name":"Spellcasting:","value":"If your response rhymes, gain an ammo for a night ability of your choice."},{"name":"Poison Apple (0x, 50% Charge):","value":"Use alongside Factional Poison.
