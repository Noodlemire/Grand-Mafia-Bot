This and the following two evenings, you will learn a random number within 8 percentage points (then 9 the next evening, then 10 the following evening) of your target's score (e.g. true score 53% first evening, you get a result between 45 and 61%). If this number is more than 10 percentage points below your score, you will also learn their sub-alignment."},{"name":"Bribe (charge X%):","value":"Target a player you've used What's Your Price on within the past 3 evenings. Spend charge equal to 3x your most recent result for What's Your Price result for that player (but no less than 120%). If the player is Town-aligned, you will convert that player's alignment to Corrupt (if not, only 1/3 the charge is spent). They will retain their role and abilities, but adopt the Mafia win condition and gain access to the Mafia factional chat. Any previously Locked abilities will be re-Locked. Note: Corrupt players may not use the Factional Attack."},{"name":"Slush Fund (Passive):","value":"As long as you are alive, other Mafia- or Corrupt-aligned players may elect (during the evening phase, before results) to transfer between 1 and 5 percentage points of their score to you at night.
