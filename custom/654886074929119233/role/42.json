Target a player, and if they die tonight, they will be revived at the start of tomorrow night. They will be told upon death that their death may not be permanent. This player will still be regarded as dead during the day phase, meaning voting majority will be calculated without them, and the game can end as it would if they permanently died. You may not target yourself with this."},{"name":"Life Lesson (passive):","value":"If you’re the last member of the Mafia and get lynched, you will learn your lesson and obtain a neutral alignment that can win with any faction whose win conditions allow its presence.
